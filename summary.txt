My name is Karishma Rahaman, and I am currently a third-year B.Tech Computer Science student at Vellore Institute of Technology. I have a strong interest in web development and AI technologies, and while there is still much I aim to learn, my passion for technology drives me to continuously explore and grow across different domains. Beyond academics, I am also a passionate otaku, which reflects my curiosity, creativity, and love for diverse storytelling
